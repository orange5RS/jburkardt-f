## GEOMETRY
Geometric Calculations

GEOMETRY is a FORTRAN90 library which carries out geometric calculations in 2, 3 and N dimensional space.

These calculations include angles, areas, containment, distances, intersections, lengths, and volumes.

Some geometric objects can be described in a variety of ways. For instance, a line has implicit, explicit and parametric representations. The names of routines often will specify the representation used, and there are routines to convert from one representation to another.

Another useful task is the delineation of a standard geometric object. For instance, there is a routine that will return the location of the vertices of an octahedron, and others to produce a series of "equally spaced" points on a circle, ellipse, sphere, or within the interior of a triangle.

An open source directory of computational geometry routines is available at http://www.cgal.org, the Computational Geometry Algorithms Library.
